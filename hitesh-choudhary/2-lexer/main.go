// Lexer -> It simply understands the grammer of the language and it checks the statement that is written is correct or not .
// it is done before the program is run by the compiler
// its check whether we are following the rules or not
// sometimes we dont need to put semicolons at some points because lexer go through that statement and will automatically puts semicolon over there

/*
